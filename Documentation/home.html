			<p><b>SCH</b> is a modern high-level general purpose programming language. Its goal is to be fast, but still intuitive and practical. It features <b>classes</b>, <b>null safety</b>, <b>detailed error messages</b>, <b>automatic memory management</b>, and a <b>simple</b> and <b>modern</b> syntax.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Features</h3>
		<p><b>Memory management</b>:<br>
		SCH is compiled but there are no memory leaks or life time problems like in bad C code or complicated memory managing systems like in Rust. Instead, it uses shared pointers to give the user a Java/C#-like experience. Of course, this slightly reduces the efficiency, but it's worth it.</p>
		<p><b>Error messages</b>:<br>
		Error messages always tell you exactly where the error occured, even at runtime.</p>
		<p><b>Smart casting</b>:<br>
		SCH features smart casting of classes and nullables in most simple cases.
